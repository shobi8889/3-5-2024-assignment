            <mark>A web browser is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. It further provides for the capture or input of information which may be returned to the presenting system, then stored or processed as necessary. 
                The method of accessing a particular page or content is achieved by entering its 
                address, known as a Uniform Resource Identifier or URI. 
                This may be a web page, image, video, or other piece of content.
                Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to 
                related resources. A web browser can also be defined as an application software or 
                program designed to enable users to access, retrieve and view documents and other 
                resources on the Internet.

        Precursors to the web browser emerged in the form of hyperlinked applications during 
        the mid and late 1980s, and following these, Tim Berners-Lee is credited with 
        developing, in 1990, both the first web server, and the first web browser, called 
        WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and later renamed Nexus. Many others were soon developed, 
        with Marc Andreessen's 1993 Mosaic (later Netscape), being particularly easy to 
        use and install, and often credited with sparking the internet boom of the 1990s.
        Today, the major web browsers are Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, and Edge.

    The explosion in popularity of the Web was triggered in September 1993 by NCSA Mosaic,
    a graphical browser which eventually ran on several popular office and home computers.
    This was the first web browser aiming to bring multimedia content to non-technical 
    users, and therefore included images and text on the same page, unlike previous 
    browser designs; its founder, Marc Andreessen, also established the company that 
    in 1994, released Netscape Navigator, which resulted in one of the early browser wars, 
    when it ended up in a competition for dominance (which it lost) with Microsoft's 
    Internet Explorer (for Windows).
